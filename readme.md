## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Reddit API credentials (Client ID and Client Secret)

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web3-sentiment-analyzer.git
   cd web3-sentiment-analyzer
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure Reddit API credentials**:
   Create a `.env` file in the project root with:
   ```
   REDDIT_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
   REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
   ```

## üöÄ Running the Application

Run the application using the provided script:

```bash
python run_app.py
```

Alternatively, you can run directly with Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run src/app.py
```

The web interface will open automatically in your default browser.

## üí° Usage Guide

1. **Configure Analysis Parameters**:
   - Enter keywords related to Web3 topics (one per line)
   - Select subreddits to analyze
   - Set the maximum number of posts to retrieve per keyword/subreddit
   - Choose whether to include comment analysis

2. **Run the Analysis**:
   - Click "Start Analysis" to begin data collection and sentiment processing
   - The progress bar will show the current status of the analysis

3. **Explore Results**:
   - Review the overall sentiment metrics
   - Analyze the sentiment distribution charts
   - Compare sentiment across different subreddits
   - Examine detailed post and comment data in expandable sections

## üß† How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The application connects to Reddit via PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper) and retrieves posts containing the specified keywords from selected subreddits
   
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Using Hugging Face's transformers library, the application analyzes the sentiment of each post and comment, assigning them a sentiment category (positive, negative, or neutral) and a confidence score

3. **Visualization**: The processed data is visualized using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Streamlit's native charting capabilities

4. **Interactive Results**: Users can interact with the data through Streamlit's interface, drilling down into specific aspects of the analysis
