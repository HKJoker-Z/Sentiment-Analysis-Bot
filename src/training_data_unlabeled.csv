"Web3 Consultants: What's the REAL state of the industry in 2025? I'm considering a career pivot into blockchain technical consulting but want to get beyond the hype and understand the reality of the market. If you're currently working as a Web3 consultant:

1. **Client Acquisition**: How are you finding clients? What's been most effective?
2. **Project Types**: What kind of blockchain implementations are clients actually paying for? Any specific use cases gaining traction?
3. **Challenges**: What's been the most difficult part of consulting in this space?
4. **Pricing**: How do you structure your fees? Project-based, hourly, retainer?
5. **Skills**: Beyond blockchain knowledge, what skills have proven most valuable?
6. **Market Reality**: Honestly, is there enough demand to sustain a consulting practice focused solely on blockchain/Web3?

Not looking for generic advice or theoretical answers. Only interested in hearing from people actively doing this work day-to-day.

Thank you for any insights you can share!"
"Anyone else think .eth domains feel kinda... outdated? I‚Äôve been using an .eth domain for a while, but lately I‚Äôm seeing newer .web3 domains popping up that actually do something. Like instead of pointing to a wallet, they host an actual AI agent or website. Curious if anyone here has tried that route.

Is this just another NFT wrapper or is it the future of identity?"
"What‚Äôs the most confusing Web3 landing page you‚Äôve come across? I'll go first... Been digging through a bunch of Web3 sites lately, and one thing keeps popping up ‚Äî they look sick‚Ä¶ but half the time I‚Äôm left wondering ‚Äúwhat does this actually do?‚Äù

Curious what you‚Äôve seen out there. Which landing page totally lost you?

I‚Äôll go first:  
**Berachain.** Love the vibe, the branding, all of it. But the reverse scrolling? Lost me for a minute üòÖ

Just think we‚Äôre at a point where clean UX > visual flexing. Especially if you want people to stick around and actually take action.

"How true web3 social is gonna look like? I know there are many experiments going on in Web3 social space. Mastadon to DeSo to Warp to lens protocol. 

Why people need social media in Web3 way iyo 
? Data privacy and ownership. Censorship resistance. Apart from these points, what's really gonna shape up web3 social behavior in users. Because web3 is all about DeFi still now. To get mass scale web3 adoption for social media that requires a different motivation.

And existing social media is running on complex backend architecture. I understand all of the components are not fully developed and available in web3. 

So what do you think future of social media on Web3?"
"Anyone here using Telegram DMs for Web3 sales or collab outreach? Curious to know if people here use Telegram as a serious sales/distribution channel in Web3.

Has anyone tried finding Telegram handles based on other signals like email signups, wallet metadata, or even LinkedIn? What worked? What didn‚Äôt? T

"Would you pay crypto to guarantee your message gets noticed by someone important? The idea is simple ‚Äî Priority Ping lets you send¬†*high-priority messages*¬†to people who are hard to reach (like founders, creators, VCs, influencers, etc.), by attaching a small amount of crypto to your message.

Here‚Äôs how it works:  
You write a message and attach any amount of crypto (your choice). The recipient only receives the crypto if they¬†*open*the message. If they don‚Äôt, the crypto automatically returns to you after a set time (like 7 days). It‚Äôs all handled via smart contract ‚Äî no middlemen.

If they like your message, they can choose to respond. If they don‚Äôt, no hard feelings ‚Äî your funds are returned.

It‚Äôs a new way to cut through the noise, especially in a world where cold DMs and unsolicited emails rarely get noticed. With Priority Ping, attention becomes opt-in, incentivized, and respectful.

We‚Äôre designing it as a lightweight layer on top of Web3 identities ‚Äî compatible with wallets, ENS, Lens, Farcaster handles, etc. Think of it like a trustless ‚Äústamp‚Äù for messagi"
"Need Help - Web3 Supply Chain Hi everyone,

I‚Äôm currently working on a university project where I‚Äôm developing an app designed to create a proof of supply chain using blockchain technology. The app will allow multiple stakeholders ‚Äì manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and so on ‚Äì to register and log various events in the supply chain process. These events will help establish a verified, end-to-end proof of the supply chain using blockchain. While I have experience with web technologies like Angular, React, and Next.js, this is my first time dealing with blockchain, and I‚Äôm having a hard time figuring out the best way to structure and implement the app.

I‚Äôm specifically struggling with how to design the flow of the app, especially in terms of user authentication and wallet integration. For authentication, I‚Äôm unsure about which data fields need to be set up for stakeholders to sign up and how to manage the approval process once they register. Beyond that, I‚Äôm struggling to understand how to integrate wallets an"
"Are there any successful web3 crowdfunded games? I've been very interested in the web3 space for a while, and I have an idea in my head that I want to make a reality. Unfortunately I am not really a member of the space, I don't have any notions. I want to make a prototype, and I am convinced I can make it convincing and intriguing enough to get people interested; but will that sort of thing be enough to get the funding needed to turn a prototype into a fully-fledged game, or is that not viable in this space?"
"How Do You See Web3 Changing User Ownership Over the Next 5 Years? One thing that keeps me fascinated about Web3 is the shift from platform-owned content to user-owned assets, identities, and data.

But realistically, what does that shift *look* like in the coming years? With so many new protocols and tools emerging, it feels like we‚Äôre inching closer to a future where users actually have more control. But will this ownership model become the norm, or will it stay niche?

Would love to hear thoughts from folks building, researching, or just observing the space."
"Who would you recommend others follow on social media? I'm looking for some accounts or folks to follow on social media, specifically microblogging platforms (Twitter/X, BlueSky, Mastodon, etc.), which I've recently rejoined after a pretty long layoff - think before Elon let that sink in - and I've never been that active to begin with. I usually read long-form content on Substack, here, or blogs but I'm trying to get back into more organic discussions. 

The problem I'm finding is that both the algorithmic and search recommendations are generally terrible. Most of them are your standard crypto shllls, bots, or posting about how the latest memecoin rug pull went down, which I couldn't care less about. I follow a few writers and people they engage with on their feeds but I want to broaden my perspective a little. 

I'm mostly looking for commentators, builders, and innovators. People like Chris Dixon or Vitalik but who do more than repost stuff on their feed. And obviously none of the above shills, etc. Can the fine folks of this sub help me"
"Using Web3 Tools This is a gripe I have had since I began hearing about Web3 and more about hearing the reasons why, it's intended to motivate... SO... As I'm sure most in the Web3 community have experirnced, a new Web3 project has come along, proposing new things amd then it sits and noone uses it and it dies. Meanwhile, there is much discussion on Web2 platforms: X, Reddit, Discord... 

If the Web3 community is building these projects then not using them, how will they ever take off? I am applying for Web3 jobs and they want me to be proficient in Adobe, Microsoft and Google products to work at their Web3 company, using Web2 products to design images and videos for Web3.

I had such hope and enthusiasm to move beyond Web2 but it just seems stalled. Was Web3 too exclusive at inception? The attitude I've heard of ""People being too stupid for Web3,"" seems to go against the idea of using design to solve problems.

AI democratizing coding helps get through arrogant gatekeepers as well.

"How AI is reshaping Web3.0 industry? Currently, AI is doing excellent work at coding, testing, writing scripts, and basically taking SDE jobs in a Web 2.0 environment.

"Feeling the pulse in the US Quick check with our American friends: under this administration, are people more concerned about their digital privacy and their corporate data security? Do you think more people are looking at the Web3 as a sanctuary from government and big tech?

Here in Europe the general feeling is that US tech companies cannot be trusted with personal and business data anymore. It's not so much the companies' fault, but trust in the rule of law in the US has been eroding.

Friends in America, any thoughts?"
"Is it possible to build an e-commerce platform using Web3 to allow US users to evade tariffs? For example, on this Web3 e-commerce platform, buyers and sellers transact anonymously using addresses. After the buyer places an order, they stake tokens through the Lightning Network. Once the buyer enters a key and a specified time period elapses, the tokens are automatically transferred to the seller's address, solving the payment channel problem.

The logistics aspect is more challenging. Mango intends to tax shipments under $800, but I doubt its enforceability due to the enormous administrative workload. If such taxation can‚Äôt be effectively implemented, then using postal parcels could potentially avoid tariffs.

From this perspective, the idea is feasible‚Äîespecially when Amazon drastically increase product prices."
"[Idea Check] Would you invest in a bilingual Web3 media platform with global reach? Hey builders ‚Äî I‚Äôve spent the last few years growing a media site focused on Web3/crypto in both English and Turkish.

"Web3 in Healthcare Over the past couple months I‚Äôve been helping my grandparents who are both suffering from dementia and need assistance with a lot of things around their home. Naturally, this also includes getting them to and from doctors visits and I‚Äôve begun to notice a problem, and there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm the only one who‚Äôs dealt with it. 

There‚Äôs a LOT of back and forth that happens with sending paperwork, conferring with insurance, and telephone calls to get the simplest things done. It would be somewhat bearable if every call or email pushed another action but I‚Äôve noticed that the PCP will need something, request it from the insurance company who didn‚Äôt specify they needed something slightly different and it becomes this ping pong game of ambiguous requests.

"Is there a Web3 solution for transferring contacts & profiles across platforms? I‚Äôve been thinking about how frustrating it is to move contacts and profiles between different platforms (and how much market power it gives these companies). Every time you join a new app, you have to rebuild your connections from scratch. There should be a way to manage and transfer contacts in a decentralized way while still keeping control over privacy.



I know about **Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs)**‚Äîcould they be part of the solution? Imagine a system where:

‚Ä¢ You control access to your contacts across platforms.

‚Ä¢ People who have you on **Instagram** could see which other profiles you allow them to add you on - they will only be able to see the other profiles you allow them to see. 

‚Ä¢ If someone only has your **phone number or WhatsApp**, you could limit their access to only other chat apps or specific ones. 

‚Ä¢ You can instantly delete or revoke access to profiles when needed.

I live in the U.S., so curious what that means out there in the UE. Trying to make sure I see what is legally possible with crypto so that I'm not affected too negatively business-wise since I plan on running the business with crypto due to it's potential to bridge the gap between paying folks here and globally.

"Is Laravel (Php) a Good Choice for Web3 Development? Hey everyone! üëã

"AI is Becoming Too Centralized ‚Äì How Do We Fix It? üëã AI has become too centralized. A few companies (OpenAI, Google, AWS) control model access, limit research, and dictate what AI can and cannot do.

üö® The problem?
	‚Ä¢	Centralized AI models enforce censorship & bias
	‚Ä¢	Limited access ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt work for Big Tech, you‚Äôre locked out
	‚Ä¢	Data exploitation ‚Äì User data is monetized for profit

"Web3 Startup idea validation/Looking for cofounder Hi,
I've got interested in web3 startup field recently, i'd like to start something as I've already founded two products completly from scratch, that got in to founding or were sold in MVP stage. I've got one idea that I'd like to validate with someone, or maybe there is someone looking for technical cofounder for their idea. I got only one requirement, I'm looking for someone with actual skills or successes in different field , preferably web3 marketing.

"Built a platform to connect web2 payments with web3 Always wanted to get paid in crypto as a freelancer especially USDC but most of my clients did not know anything about it, so we made a payments platform to solve the issue,¬†[coinfella.io](http://coinfella.io/)

This is how it solves my problem. A freelancer can send a payment request or an invoice to their client, and the clients just have to use their cards to pay the payment request, and the freelancer gets USDC straight to their private wallet eliminating the need for crypto knowledge by the client. We do this by working with the two giants, Circle and Stripe.

"Is it possible to make an exchange web app with a daily limit  So I'm pretty new with the crypto, web3, dapp, ... field

My boss want me to make a web app that allow user to exchange from TokenA to TokenB, but he want to make it so that a user can only exchange a limited amount everyday.

I have been looking at some tutorial on youtube how to build this app. But most tutorial that I have seen used the 1inch API in the frontend which will expo everything and user can just make their own transactions without any limit.

Is it possible to build this app, do I just hide the token addresses in the backend, won't it be shown in the transactions ?

"Are ENS domains actually valuable? Hi there!
I'm curious to know your thoughts about ENS domains.

Now that a couple of years have passed, what do you think are the main reasons a business should buy their web3 domain name?

"Upgradeable proxy pattern: trading-off smart contract immutability for security? Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seems like there's a consensus among blockchain security analysts about the need to use only [upgradeable proxy](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/proxy) contracts for our dapps. The rationale is that bugs could be patched before someone finds out how to exploit them as security vulnerabilities.

Fair enough. But one desirable feature of dapps is the immutability of the on-chain contract. The idea being that, as a user, you can read the code and then choose to interact with it, knowing that the conditions can't change. Wouldn't upgradeability hurt user's trust in the contract?

Imagine, for example, that someone releases an NFT collection of 1000 tokens, each mintable for 1 ETH. They set a 1% royalty for market transactions and they add a very strong guarantee: holders can, at any time, refund the token for 1 ETH. The smart contract is expected to hold the minting funds for possible refunds. The contract owner only profits from resales.

"I cracked the code on Web3 client acquisition (and no, it's not just spamming Discord servers) Hey Web3 folks,

So I've been tinkering with some growth hacking stuff for Web3 lately, and I thought I'd share some interesting things I've found. Figured it might help some of you out there trying to grow your projects or land clients.

Here's some of the cool stuff I discovered:

1. There's actually a way to spot companies about to launch tokens. Talk about good timing, right?
2. You can use AI to scan websites and figure out who might need Web3 services. Feels a bit like cheating, but in a good way.
3. Turns out, recently funded startups are goldmines if you're offering services. Makes sense when you think about it.
4. If you've got one solid client, there's a neat trick to find more just like them. It's pretty slick.
5. And get this - cold emails can actually work if you do them right. I know, I was shocked too.

I made a video diving into all this stuff because it got a bit too detailed for a Reddit post. If you're curious, [https://youtu.be/pA0mIchfup8](https://youtu.be/pA0mIchf"
"Good chains for utility dapps GM! This week we're launching Neulock Web3 Password Manager on Ethereum L1 and Arbitrum One, Base, and Optimism L2.

We've decided to start with Ethereum and its largest L2s due to security considerations. But the user should be free to choose whatever blockchain they prefer, so we want to be present wherever the user wants us. Moreover, the only security risk of using a poor chain is to the availability: since Neulock syncs passwords without ever exporting any secrets (not even under encryption) and the frontend verifies all data, there's no risk to password confidentiality and integrity. So, while we're confident that passwords synced with Neulock will remain confidential in any chain, it's up to the user to evaluate their favorite chain's availability guarantees.

After we are done launching on Ethereum and the big L2s, we'll be looking for more niche-oriented chains that are heavy on utility dapps and privacy-minded users. Any recommendations?

Thanks in advance!

"Scope of Adapting the Tap-to-Earn Mechanics to Larger PvP Web3 Games (RPGs/Adventure) Given how Tap-to-Earn games operate with numerous transactions occurring in a short time frame, surely this requires a blockchain able to support the necessary transaction speed. Now, could we explore a similar concept for a larger game, such as a fantasy RPG (adventure/PvP)? In this case, maybe instead of simple 'taps,' players could initiate several transactions by performing specific special attacks or moves against enemies.

"How do I promote my Web3 SaaS for tracking calls? So, here‚Äôs my story‚ÄîI‚Äôve been deep in the Web3 and shitcoin trading world for a while now.

That‚Äôs when I decided to take matters into my own hands. I built a platform that pulls together calls from all over, grabs the token price at the time of the call, and follows its price trajectory over time. It‚Äôs like having a scorecard for calls, all in one place.

 Hi,  
I am a student from 42 Berlin and with a few other peers we are developing an app that allow Telegram users to sell their chat history for AI training or fine tuning (the data is anonymised and not used for ads)

So the backbone idea of our project is to inform individual users but also to give them the possibility to earn money for what they have.  
Web3 is new for me and even though we are not (yet) a Dapp I think we are Web3 in our core.

"Should We Find Some New Consensus of Web3 Society, Besides ""Decentralization""? Hi guys, I wonder whether you feel it necessary to reconsider the basic values of Web3 society, *""decentralization""*?

We do need decentralization, but only a certain type: decentralization with a sound consensus that can bring people together sustainably while also allowing for the creation of diversities. Such a consensus, rather than the concept of ""decentralization"" itself, should be the real essence of Web3 society. We don't need consensuses that bring people together only through monetary incentives or that stifle creativity.

The challenge to achieve an ideal consensus for Web3 society lies in the complexity of its membership. As Web3 society grows across more than a hundred countries, it's becoming increasingly important to create a basic cultural consensus for all these people to work together.

However, mathematical consensus, which only offers technical promises, cannot provide cultural support. We still need to agree on the cultural meaning of our current work. We do things"

I'm developing a dapp, and things worked well on a local Hardhat node. Then I deployed the smart contract to Sepolia, and my dapp randomly gets stale information from read\_contract() calls.

It was using rpc.sepolia.org as the RPC provider and then I changed it to ethereum-sepolia-rpc.publicnode.com. After the change. I started getting fresh reads more often, but occasionally it will return a stale read.

I haven't identified any pattern. Sometimes it will get a fresh read, and the next call will return stale (older) data.

"Password manager dapp: is Ethereum L1 worth it? I'm bringing Neulock password manager to the web3. Thanks to its zero-knowledge nature, this password manager can store data onchain without compromising security.

Our team has finalized the security architecture. Roughly speaking, the user will sign in with WalletConnect by performing an Ethereum personal\_sign on a constant string. Two keys will be derived from the resulting hash: a Neulock master key, and an AES encryption key. This way, the user can access their passwords on any device simply by connecting to their wallet.

The encrypted blob of user data will be uploaded to IPFS/FileCoin. As usual with Neulock, this data includes no secrets, even after decryption. An updated reference to the current CID of this user data will be kept in an EVM smart contract.

Password creation and updates can be batched, so users can make/change many passwords and commit only one transaction, reducing gas fees.

We're now having heated discussions about what chain will host the smart contract.

"Need some insight on the feasibility of web3 development I am a hobbyist developer who has supported Bitcoin and blockchain for quite a while, and I would love to get into web3 development, but I am missing what the incentives are for a decentralized cluster of nodes to be run if there is no financial underpinning (I.E token) to incentivize node runners to keep their machines running to keep the security of the network up and keep it decentralized.

What am I missing here?   

If say I work on top of Solana or Ethereum, for example with smart contracts or tokenization project, then wouldn't there have to be some built in token integration into my project? Designing around this seems like a nightmare."
"Can the blockchain be used to provide a more reliable debt instrument than US treasury bonds? Given the recent volatility observed in the US treasury markets caused by Trump's tariffs, I've seen many conversations where an alternative to the dollar is proposed as a potential replacement as the world's reserve currency.  
The typical issue for even more stable alternatives tend to be the size of the economies (like Germany and the Nordic countries).

Would it be possible to create a financial instrument (likely using a blockchain like the USDT) which is built on top of a mixture of treasury bonds of stable economies. US treasury bonds would still be a major part but could also include various European bonds (like Germany and the Nordic countries), leading Asian econonmies like Japan and China. Hopefully, emerging markets can also be in the mix.

My understanding is the diversification should reduce risk while maintaining or even increasing yields? I'm curious to get the opinion of folks about the potential downsides that I seem to have missed as this is not an idea that is float"
"Using NFTs for Certificates/Credentials So, everyone knows NFTs mostly for overpriced monkey pictures, but there‚Äôs actually a real use case that makes a lot of sense‚Äîcertificates, licenses, and credentials on the blockchain.

Imagine getting your college degree, professional certification, or even a training completion certificate as an NFT. No more worrying about losing a paper copy or dealing with third-party verification. You could just share a link, and boom‚Äîinstant proof, verifiable on the blockchain.

Some big advantages:
‚úÖ No fakes ‚Äì it‚Äôs on-chain and can‚Äôt be altered
‚úÖ Easy to share ‚Äì no need for complicated verification processes
‚úÖ Always accessible ‚Äì no losing it in your email or a drawer somewhere

It seems like a no-brainer, but I don‚Äôt see it talked about as much. What do you think? Are there any projects already doing this well? Or are there flaws in this idea I‚Äôm missing? Let‚Äôs discuss!"

"Testing and Demoing dApps as a Frontend DeveloperTesting and Demoing dApps as a Frontend Developer Hey everyone

I'm a frontend developer with experience in TS, React, Viem, Ethers and with some Solidity knowledge.

I've recently been asked to do a freelance job for a crypto protocol that is going to be launched on a minor EVM compatible chain. The Smart Contracts are already develop and all I have to do is the UI and connect the UI to the Smart Contracts.

In other gigs I did, during development I would deploy the contracts in the Testnet and then plug the frontend into these testnets contracts and go from there. I would also use the Testnets contracts to allow my client to test the dApp on its own.

However this chain doesn't have a reliable testnet and the protocol actually interacts a lot with other contracts that are deployed on the mainnet. I don't want to deploy this in the mainnet since I'll be spending a lot in fees.

The obvious answer would be running a local blockchain on my machine but the last time I did was a while ago and I remember struggling a bit with it. I would "

"1 to 1 // Human to User - authentic technical solution?  I always figured blockchain technology was the solution to authenticated 1 for 1, human to user engagement/interaction. For example, a person can only engage once on a given interaction on a platform. In other words, one person cannot create multiple user profiles to engage with the platform.
This is somewhat the bot dilemma but also the prevention of authentic but duplicated user profiles to one human.
Now, I'm hearing that blockchain isn't really the solution to this problem. Does anyone know if that's true? Or does anyone have any helpful resources in this area?"

I am looking into web 3 and have noticed the hype around web 3 gaming but I am having my question, being a gamer myself I feel like I have a pretty good idea what is going on in the gaming industry right now. My thought process is: for an innovation to be 'accepted' or rather used. For people to swap to somethin new, said innovation needs to actually 'innovate'. Do something new that people want, or fix a problem people want fixed.**

**So, what would be the biggest problem right now in the gaming industry? In my eyes, this is big companies not making games for gamers, but solely for making money, shareholder have a lot of influence on the development and push games out before they are ready, this would result in unfinished games who are not enjoyable for another half a year of patching. In the case of big games like mmo's this results in pay 2 win marketplaces and or patches/expansions that are underwhelming yet are necessary for progression. Good exa"

"Open source DeFi aggregator ? Hey, I'm currently working on an app with the aim of relying as little as possible on trusted third parties.

I searched for open source pathfinding algorithm but nothing, 1inch, paraswap, 0x... All their pathfinders are closed and rely on a private API.

So is there any open source algorithm that I can include in my app to be run locally instead of calling externals api ?

If not do you think it's acceptable to rely on them ? By adding a bit of trust in my app to gain efficiency ?

I admit that in principle I told myself that it was important that everything was done locally, without the need of trust, but maybe it's not that disturbing for this kind of thing? "

"Ethereum is inherently more scalable than Web2 **Ethereum is the first system where the capacity to grow isn't bottlenecked by centralized teams or a locked-in feature set, and this makes it inherently more scalable than Web2.**

To elaborate: Ethereum is the first political system that is fully formalized ‚Äî and therefore mechanically enforced ‚Äî and whose rulebook is general-purpose. Like Bitcoin, anyone can join, validate, or transact without approval ‚Äî rules are code, enforcement is consensus. But because Ethereum‚Äôs rulebook is general-purpose, i.e. its execution environment is Turing-complete, anyone can also introduce new functionality without a hard fork.

"New Ethereum narrative: ""ETH is Smart Digital Gold"" ‚Äî and Why It Matters Ethereum has outgrown its old narratives ‚Äî and it's time we updated the way we communicate its value.

Let me break it down:

ETH = Smart Digital Gold

It‚Äôs intuitive. Catchy. Easy to explain.

People already understand what¬†digital gold¬†means thanks to Bitcoin. But Ethereum goes beyond that ‚Äî it‚Äôs programmable, versatile, and¬†smart.

Old narratives have served their purpose,but they don't stick with the average person.Heres why:

‚Ä¢ ""Ethereum is digital oil"" Who wants to invest in oil?

‚Ä¢ ""Ethereum is money""Money doesn‚Äôt appreciate or excite.

‚Ä¢ ""Ethereum is a triple-point asset"" Too abstract,too long.

Think of it like this:

Ethereum is to Bitcoin what a smartphone is to a basic phone.

You don‚Äôt need to know how a smartphone works to recognize its power. Same with Ethereum ‚Äî you don‚Äôt need to understand smart contracts to see the apps, stablecoins, NFTs, rollups, and the ecosystem it enables.

Ethereum is:

‚Ä¢ A store of value
‚Ä¢ A capital-generating asset
‚Ä¢ A platform for DeFi, NFTs,"
"ETH is a store of value and scaling Ethereum will make it undeniable As we scale on L1 and L2, there's a couple things to keep in mind about how it affects ETH, tokenomics, and how it's viewed by the world:

1. As L1 gas limits and blobs increase, the deflationary threshold decreases proportionally. For example, right now the L1 gas limit is at 36M and the deflationary threshold it 14.5 gwei. At a 300M gas limit the deflationary threshold becomes 1.74 gwei (14.5gwei\*36M/300M).
2. As it becomes cheaper to use L1 and L2, that scaling creates potential/opportunity for new/different usecases which increases demand. For example, [this game](https://x.com/megaeth_labs/status/1913249693196599615) or [this game](https://x.com/IAmNickDodson/status/1919762394797982135) where every action is onchain is a new possibility that will fill in **low** cost blockspace. Unbanked usecases like subscriptions and payment streams such as access to games, blogs, licensing (music, shows, patents, trademarks), services (food delivery, hosting), rentals (physical goods), etc wil"

"Did Ethereum just quietly turn deflationary again post-Pectra? I was checking ultrasound.money today and noticed something interesting ‚Äî the issuance is showing negative again.

At first glance, it might look like a display bug or a side effect of a UI/data update ‚Äî but what if it‚Äôs not?

A few technical angles to consider:
EIP-1559 continues to burn base fees during high network activity. If post-Pectra adjustments (e.g. gas target changes, blob dynamics with Danksharding prep) altered fee pressure or burn cadence, the burn could now regularly outpace issuance again.

Staking rewards are currently the main source of ETH issuance. But with validator growth slowing and rewards decreasing due to network saturation, net new issuance is shrinking.

Blob-carrying txs (EIP-4844) and potential fee market pressure may also be increasing ETH burn indirectly by maintaining higher base fees.

Now the question is:
Is this just a display glitch or a temporary artifact from a recent update?
Or has Pectra introduced a structural change pushing ETH back into defl"
"Security implications of PECTRA upgrade something I have stumbled upon:

""Reminder guys: now with PECTRA ethereum upgrade, you only need to sign a message to get completely drained! Before, you actually had to sign the TX.

Be very careful of what you sign now - even an offchain message!"""
"Immediately after Pectra upgrade, the OBOL Token is now live for Trading and Staking! This comes just minutes after the Pectra upgrade, showing the Obol Collective's confidence in Ethereum and its roadmap. "
"Pectra is now live on Ethereum Mainnet! The highly anticipated upgrade has landed and it brings major improvements to staking, blob handling for L2s, and user experience.

No delays. Just a smooth rollout.

How Layer-2 Solutions Are Helping to Scale Ethereum 
"Bitcoin Gets Its Own ‚ÄúRollups‚Äù? KIP-31 Introduces Drivechain-Based Subnets with Ordinal Permissioning I found an article about this:

>While Ethereum has been leading the charge with rollups and modular scaling, a recent proposal is aiming to bring similar programmability and scale to Bitcoin ‚Äî in a very Bitcoin-native way.

>Introducing KIP-31, a proposal from the Koii Network that introduces:

>üîπ Bitcoin-backed rollups via drivechain anchoring

>üîπ Subnet permissioning using Bitcoin ordinals

>üîπ A fork of a Solana-style high-throughput chain to handle smart contracts and execution

>Instead of pushing smart contracts onto Bitcoin directly, this design uses a rollup architecture where state commitments anchor to Bitcoin, and subnet access is managed via ordinal inscriptions (yes, like NFTs ‚Äî but functional).

>This raises a few big questions for us as Ethereum folks:

>\- Can Bitcoin evolve toward programmability without breaking its conservative consensus model?

"For those looking to invest in ETH ETFs, here's some in-depth research **TL;DR: ETHA (BlackRock ETH ETF) is the best one to invest in**

Canadians have a TFSA (Tax-Free Savings Account) where realized gains are untaxed. I wanted to take advantage of these tax-free gains. In the US, there are also Roth-IRA's that function similarly.

I've searched on Reddit and other places to figure out which ETF to invest in, as there are multiple options. I saw ETHE, ETHA, ETH (which is Mini Ethe or Grayscale Ethereum Mini), etc..  and couldn't find a straight answer.

I decided to use ChatGPT 4.5  + In-Depth Research mode to figure this out for me.

Here are the results:

"Open-source collaboration to build people-vote consensus engine, anyone interested? I've followed Ethereum since 2014 and I realized around 2016/2017 that the next step would be to go from cpu-vote and coin-vote to people-vote. Game theoretically and mathematically, people-vote is identical to coin-vote, 1 coin is just replaced by 1 person, and the ideal way to do it is delegated people-vote where a validator that holds 10% of all people-votes would be analogous to a validator that holds 10% of all staked coins.

Those years, 2015-2018, I also designed and later implemented what I think is the ideal proof-of-unique-person, Bitpeople (dot) org. But, the point with a people-vote conensus engine (a modified Ethereum or equivalent) is that it could be used regardless of what the proof-of-unique-person is. It could be used by every country in the world, for a ""national blockchain"" such as a Danish blockchain for Denmark. And it could be used by alternative proof-of-unique-person systems that could attempt to prove themselves as being superior to the (very good) legacy nati"

"What If One Ethereum Validator Could Be Run by Many? In a space where decentralization is everything, relying on a single point of failure never really made sense to me. The more we spread out control and responsibility, the stronger and more resilient the network becomes. That‚Äôs why the concept of providing some Network that will help make things right comes to my mind.  
  
I was busy researching it, but I saw some other ones, like Obol, trying to use Distributed Validator Technology (DVT). DVT basically means a group of operators can work together to run one validator. It‚Äôs a smarter, safer way to support Ethereum‚Äôs Proof of Stake system.  
  
With hundreds of operators already involved and over a billion dollars secured, staking seems to be more collaborative and less risky. While opened to everyone, from home stakers to large scale validators, and offers tools and incentives to help you get started.  
  
Whether you‚Äôre deep into Ethereum or just learning how staking works, these kind of networks seem to be shaping a future where res"

"Block selection by people-vote instead of coin-vote or cpu-vote I followed Ethereum since 2014 (started designing and building¬†Bitpeople¬†on Ethereum in 2015) and saw it as one of the most revolutionary technological advances in the history of civilization - I still think it is. It quite soon, within 2-3 years, became clear to me that majority rule over a ledger (via coin-vote or cpu-vote) by alternating the central authority that got to authorize a ""block"" every N units of time, as a solution to Byzantine Generals Problem (where a permanent central authority is another solution), was actually not invented by Satoshi (Craig), but it was the basis of society for hundreds of years, or thousands of years, with the nation-state - where a consensus mechanism selects a central authority for a ""block"" every N units of time (typically 4 years). And that logically the next step after coin-vote and cpu-vote as the majority rule mechanism would be people-vote.

"Privacy as a Fundamental Right Following Vitalik's recent post on privacy, I've been reflecting on how crucial this aspect is for mainstream adoption. 

Privacy isn't just a feature - it's a fundamental right in the digital age. The Pectra mainnet announcement shows we're moving in the right direction technically, but I believe we need more discussion about the ethical dimensions.

What privacy features do you consider essential for Ethereum's future? And how do we balance transparency (blockchain's strength) with privacy (users' right)?"

"Introducing ENScribe for simplified smart contract naming I've spent a lot of time recently thinking about the UX challenges in Ethereum. Something that still feels broken is how users are constantly exposed to raw hex addresses, especially when signing transactions.

Hex is completely meaningless to most people, and it introduces a lot of risk (wrong contract, phishing, etc.).

Whilst ENS supports contract naming, developers are not taking advantage of it as it's not simple to name smart contracts properly.

To help address this, we‚Äôve built¬†Enscribe, a service that lets developers and users easily name smart contracts on Ethereum, Base, and Linea (we went live on mainnets last week).

If you'd like to try it out you can head to¬†[https://app.enscribe.xyz](https://app.enscribe.xyz/).

Would love to hear feedback, good or bad ‚Äî we‚Äôre builders and want to make Ethereum safer and easier to use for everyone.

"4X increase in GAS LIMIT. Ethereum developers want to help the network handle more activity by increasing the gas limit by a factor of 4.

The gas limit controls how much work can be processed in each Ethereum block. If the gas limit is higher, more transactions can be included in each block.

They plan to increase the gas limit to 150 million in the next major upgrade, called Fusaka (expected in late 2025).

They will test it thoroughly before then, as increasing the gas limit to a larger size could lead to bugs that need to be fixed.

This change will help Ethereum handle more transactions at once without adding new features.

While the final gas limit is decided by validators, developers are working together to ensure all software is ready in time."

"Ethereum is a macro-evolutionary phenomenon for civilization Before Bitcoin, governance was heavily dependent on biological process: opaque intentions, interpreted through lossy human communication, enforced by physical coercion.

Bitcoin introduced the first political system whose governance protocol was fully formalized and automatically executed as public code. It proved that rule enforcement could be detached from subjective human interpretation and enforced mechanically through consensus. By automating enforcement, Bitcoin dramatically lowered the cost of securing a political system and opened direct participation to anyone with a computer. This created a far more resilient foundation.

But Bitcoin formalized a narrow domain: simple monetary transactions and block validation. It was a breakthrough, but a limited one ‚Äî a proof of concept that coordination could be externalized beyond human institutions.

Ethereum extends and completes this foundation. It is the first political system to fully formalize its governance while embedding a genera"

"DeFi TVL Surpasses $100 Billion Total value locked (TVL) in decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols exceeding $100 billion, a milestone not reached since March 2025, according to data from [DefiLlama](https://defillama.com/). The current TVL stands at $100.607 billion, with a 24-hour increase of 2.40%, reflecting robust growth. This resurgence is attributed to increased interest in DeFi, with Ethereum hosting a substantial portion of these protocols due to its established infrastructure and smart contract capabilities. The TVL metric, which represents the total value of assets locked in DeFi protocols, underscores Ethereum's pivotal role in the sector, with additional metrics like stablecoins market cap at $239.106 billion (+1.95% over 7 days) and RWA TVL at $11.204 billion (+1.77% over 7 days) providing context for broader market activity."
"How hard is it to create your own cryptocurrency these days? Not gonna lie, I‚Äôve been toying with the idea of launching my own token. Not because I think it‚Äôll make me rich, but just to learn how it works. Back in the day, creating an ERC-20 token seemed like something only devs could do. Now I‚Äôm hearing there are no-code tools and smart contract templates that make it a lot easier.  
  
So, how do you actually create a cryptocurrency in 2025?  
  
Is Ethereum still the go-to chain for this? Or are people launching on other networks like Solana, Polygon, or Base? Also‚Äîhow do you make sure the token is secure and not just another rug pull waiting to happen?  
  
I‚Äôm not trying to build the next SHIB or anything, but I‚Äôd love to hear from folks who‚Äôve created their own tokens. What tools did you use, and what should I avoid?"

Our platform uses bonded curve contracts to transform community building into a new asset class: 

- Community creators earn ETH on EVERY buy/sell transaction (not just when they post) 

- Content contributors earn monthly ETH rewards 

- Community tokens have mathematically guaranteed liquidity (Liquidity = Market cap) 

- No ads, no tracking, no arbitrary censorship

"Token spending approval: difference between signing a message and signing a transaction Hello,

using DeFi (mainly on L2 like Base but I assume it's the same on Ethereum), I noticed some protocols allow me to only ""sign"" a message (with no cost) to allow spending a token, while other require to sign a transaction (that has gas fees).

Could anyone explain the difference between those two spending approval? Why one or another?"

If you‚Äôve ever thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to contribute to Ethereum core, but where do I even start?‚Äù ‚Äî this is a great starting point.

Each cohort brings together a group of engineers, researchers, and curious protocol nerds to work on real projects with mentorship from client and research teams. Past fellows have contributed to things like:

* ePBS (EIP-4844 follow-up)
* Verkle trees
* PeerDAS
* Light clients
* SSZ optimizations
* Testing and tooling across the stack

This year, we have the target set on **seasoned engineers** ready to make meaningful contributions. You don‚Äôt need to be a ‚Äúprotocol wizard.‚Äù But you should be comfortable in large codebases, ready to write tests, debug weird edge cases, and iterate with feedback.

hey folks ‚Äî just wanted to share something i think many of you will appreciate.

i recently sat down with **chang-wu chen**, chief scientist at **imToken**, for a deep, honest conversation about crypto wallet design, onboarding, and the long road to mass adoption.

this is **not a paid promotion** ‚Äî no sponsorship, no incentives. just a thoughtful conversation with someone who‚Äôs been in the trenches since the early days of ethereum, working on proof-of-stake at the EF and, might i say, a conduit to rollups becoming a solution :O

we talked about:

* wallet UX and the limitations of EOAs
* gasless onboarding and trust-based design
* why fragmentation keeps new users out
* the tension between infrastructure and experience

"Centralized OS application transparency limit vs dapp Hello!
I'm new to this world, but i used to be a web developer.
I searched a lot, i asked to chatgpt, but it gives me partially correct answers.
So, the question is, if we can already develope open source applications getting GNU GPL license ( garanting the highest open source ), what's the point of developings dapp based on Blockchain, if we can get the same transparency with centralized os applications? I get the "" server thing "", it's great to avoid using a database present only in one place, managed by only one entity, is it the only reason? Could you give me an example about the "" transparency limit "" blockchain overstep over GPL licensed os applications?"

"I just realized DeFi already have single slot finalization I've always curious why Uniswap or AAVE tx only take single slot to finalize instead of 15 minutes, the theoretical finalization time. I thought maybe my amount was too little so the app just decided it doesn't need finalization.

But then I did a thought experiment. I borrow money from AAVE, use it to do stuff. Then I attack the chain to undo the borrow, so I don't have to repay. If the stuff I did was sending the money to a centralized exchange, I can withdraw it into cash and get away with it. But if whatever I did with the money was on-chain. it will become ""never happened"" after I attack the chain. Because it happened after the borrow, if the borrow didn't happen, things after it didn't happen as well. Say I staked the borrowed ETH, after the attack, the reality will become I never staked the ETH, because I never borrowed the ETH.

The conclusion is, if the receiving end has nothing to do with the real world, they don't need finalization. No damage can be done to them even if an a"
"What if the Fed disappeared? What if the Federal Reserve were abolished?

The Heritage Foundation‚Äôs Project 2025 explicitly proposes dismantling the Fed and replacing it with a free-market monetary system. Meanwhile, Trump-affiliated WLFI (World Liberty Financial Inc.) is launching a stablecoin called USD1, currently backed by U.S. treasuries.

But here‚Äôs where it gets interesting:

‚Ä¢ WLFI holds ETH, WBTC (wrapped Bitcoin), and some more.

‚Ä¢ Ethereum is the programmable layer powering DeFi, tokenized assets (RWAs), and staking infrastructure.

‚Ä¢ Bitcoin, via WBTC, could become part of a future collateral structure ‚Äì possibly alongside gold.

In this vision, Ethereum becomes the financial infrastructure layer. Bitcoin could evolve into a digital monetary reserve, especially if stablecoins like USD1 shift from purely fiat-backed models to hybrid reserves (treasuries + gold + BTC).

Scenario:

USD1 starts as 100% treasury-backed (like USDC) ‚Äì safe, regulated, stable.

"The ETH rally has only just begun. I see people on here already saying the rally is heated... but all I am seeing is the setup for a MAJOR trend reversal and prolonged price movement. I dont think we have even left the gates.

It's no surprise that Eth has significantly underperformed compared to the rest of the market. You have a lot of long term investors still sitting in losses, and what has seemed like an isolated bear market up until now. Hitting any evaluation around the ATH is pretty much baked in at this point and speculation can only truly begin once we cross that line.

The ETH/BTC ratio has finally found support after bouncing off a major trend line and the upside potential on the ratio alone is massive. With Bitcoin likely to make another 50% move ($150k seems like a conservative price target at this point) we could see the ETH ratio range from it's current levels at .02 up to .07 (7% of a Bitcoin) at the peak. 

This would put ETH at $10,500 with BTC at 150k. If BTC goes higher, then consider 7% of whatever"

"$696m worth of UTxOs deleted from Cardano by Charles Hoskinson Few days ago i wrote a thread about this on twitter, thought it would be interesting to the wider crypto community:¬†[https://x.com/masatoalexander/status/1920141651344838993](https://x.com/masatoalexander/status/1920141651344838993)

Summary:  
Charles Hoskinson rewrote the Cardano ledger in 2021 deleting ‚Ç≥318 million ($696 million at the time) of UTxOs during the Allegra hard fork.

Using his genesis keys he removed presale (ICO) UTxOs, redirecting the funds into Cardano reserves through a function called returnRedeemAddrsToReserves, and later withdrew them via a Move Instantaneous Rewards (MIR) transaction.

AFAIK this is one of the largest irregular state transitions in blockchain history (2016 Ethereum DAO hack was ~$60m at the time?)

This was a unilateral action with no community consensus, violating the core crypto principle of ""not your keys, not your crypto.""

After this change, presale buyers had to use an offchain process to claim their ADA. Hoskinson claims that most funds "
"L2 Season Is Here: Base Hits 30.83 Mgas/s - A 516% YoY Surge! Ethereum Scaling Isn't Coming, It's Happening Layer 2s are really exploding and Base is leading the charge.

As you can see in the image above Base is now hitting 30.83 Mgas/s that is a 516% year over year increase. This is not just impressive, this is a signal and a really loud one.

For those asking why, more throughput is equivalent to more compute capacity which results in cheaper fees, faster decentralized apps and scalability that can rival Web2.

This is what Ethereum scaling was always meant to unlock and day by day it is proven to be right. The rollup centric roadmap is working like a charm and we are watching the network evolve into a high performance global compute layer without compromising security or decentralization.

Furthermore, the more the infrastructure matures and developers lean into L2 native apps, expect a wave of innovation from hyper efficient DeFi protocols to on chain social platforms that w"
"A list of incredible projects in Ethereum Here's a list of incredible projects in Ethereum:

There's¬†**ZKP2P**, which runs on the Base execution protocol. It allows any web event to be used as an input in a self-executing smart contract. That means a payment on Web2 or a centralized payment system like Venmo or Revolut can be used ‚Äî trustlessly ‚Äî to execute a token swap on Ethereum. It's permissionless, it's trust-minimized, and it works by proving fiat payments without exposing any private data. In other words, this becomes an on-ramp that doesn‚Äôt require a centralized peer-to-peer fiat-to-crypto platform. It just uses Ethereum.

The next project I‚Äôm very interested in is¬†**Aztec Network**. This is a rollup-based execution protocol that settles to Ethereum and is built from the ground up to allow privacy.

"New Ethereum narrative: ""ETH is Smart Digital Gold"" ‚Äî and Why It Matters Ethereum has outgrown its old narratives ‚Äî and it's time we updated the way we communicate its value.

ETH = Smart Digital Gold

It‚Äôs intuitive. Catchy. Easy to explain.

People already understand what **digital gold** means thanks to Bitcoin. But Ethereum goes beyond that ‚Äî it‚Äôs programmable, versatile, and *smart*.

Old narratives have served their purpose,but they don't stick with the average person.Heres why:  
  
‚Ä¢ ""Ethereum is digital oil"" Who wants to invest in oil?   
  
‚Ä¢ ""Ethereum is money""Money doesn‚Äôt appreciate or excite.  
  
‚Ä¢ ""Ethereum is a triple-point asset"" Too abstract,too long.

"Is ETH ready to steal the spotlight from BTC?   
I‚Äôve been thinking about this, especially after the **Pectra upgrade** went live yesterday. To me, it kinda lays the groundwork for ETH and its whole ecosystem to finally start outperforming.

Quick recap of what Pectra brings:

* Improved scalability
* Lower gas fees
* Gas can now be paid with *different tokens*
* More incentives for validators

And if you connect the dots, this actually looks pretty bullish for ETH-based tokens too:

* Most projects could start launching new LP pools to boost staking rewards.
* That usually creates some unusual buying pressure ‚Äî both on-chain and off-chain ‚Äî and often that‚Äôs when prices get a nice push.
* Plus, paying gas with multiple tokens? That‚Äôs gonna systematically burn more tokens over time. Less supply = potentially more value (at least in theory).

Personally, I feel like Ethereum DeFi is slowly getting back in shape. We‚Äôre seeing new projects like **Obol Network** popping up (new project I think, they just had their TGE 2 days ago and go"

"üßµ Which Chain Will Win Onchain Gaming? A Dev‚Äôs View After 3 Weeks of Building and Researching üéÆ Been prototyping a fast-paced FPS game. Wanted to see if it‚Äôs even feasible to run something this responsive onchain. Spent 3 weeks testing stacks across ecosystems. Here's the reality.

‚õìÔ∏è EVM Chains (Optimism, Base, Arbitrum, Somnia)  
They‚Äôre optimized for DeFi: great for slow games like idle battlers or turn-based strategy.

üß™ Infecteddotfun on Base was a important issue for me, cuz the game was lit, everybody plated it but gameplay lagged under load. That‚Äôs the ceiling right now.

Verdict: Fine for some games. But once there is a load, the TPS and latency can't handle it. The game can't feel real-time? meaning if you were to play CSGO onchain, you would get 400ms in fastest option which is Solana. But there are solutions competing to win the gaming onchain. Here's what I think about them:

"Building AI Crypto Agents with Web3 platform integration A lot of things are happening on the AI front right now, especially in the AI agents scene, and web3 can benefit a lot from this. I have been interacting with many web3 developers, and a lot of them are building AI Crypto agents.

I have tried dabbling in this space, but the challenge was integrating web3 and crypto apps like Coinbase, Binance, and OpenSea with LLM-based agents. You have to solve for user authentication(OAuth, ApiKey) and also optimise the API calls for LLM function calling.

This can take a lot of time and energy. So, we just made AI Crypto-Kit, a comprehensive suite of Web3 platform integrations for AI agents.

We also cannot overlook the fact that personal data is usually vulnerable to breaches or misuse, and even if you decide to monetize your data, the average user lacks access to tools or platforms to participate in the data economy.

Although the project I was reading about, one that Bitget already listed VANA, mentioned enabling users to contribute their data to Data DAOs, which gives them ownership and control over their digital footprints.

### The Dero Protocol

The protocol uses a pair of rings, one for the senders, one for the receivers, represented as a singular ring. With each transfer, a list of ElGamal ciphertexts is provided for all accounts within the joint ring. This ElGamal ciphertext is formed as `r * G, (r * K) + (a * G)`, where `r` is some randomness, `K` is the key for the account the ciphertext is for, and `a` is the amount.

### The Dero Wallet Protocol

Dero offers an 'encrypted message' with every transaction. Even if the user does not explicitly provide one, a message will exist (either with internally provided values or left empty). For the only defined type of message, the message is encoded as the index of the"

"Is stated reason for deprecation of eth_decrypt justified?

On the surface, this seems reasonable‚Äîcryptographic best practices often advocate for key separation. But a closer look at how eth_decrypt functioned reveals cracks in this reasoning, suggesting the decision might mask a deeper motive.

Here‚Äôs how it worked: eth_decrypt and eth_getEncryptionPublicKey relied on asymmetric encryption. A third party could use eth_getEncryptionPublicKey to fetch a user‚Äôs public encryption key, derived from their Ethereum private key (ECDSA on secp256k1). They could then encrypt data‚Äîpotentially vast amounts‚Äîusing this key, e.g. via ECIES (Elliptic Curve Integrated Encryption Scheme).

"How to design a Proof of Work protocol that isn't an Energy-spending Maximizer Similar to how the proverbial paperclip-maximizer will eventually reconstruct all planetary matter into paperclips, Nakamoto Consensus/longest-chain is a highly-inefficient family of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus protocols that maximize energy-usage. They will stop only once the total cost of production equals the total block reward (i.e. when marginal profit == 0)

However, not all PoW protocols are as maximally energy-inefficient as Nakamoto Consensus. Some PoW protocols reduce waste and redundancy from uncle and orphaned blocks by reusing normally-discarded blocks.

**TL;DR**:

* **PoW Longest-chain**: Makes blocks expensive to produce with constant difficulty adjustments. All effort is discarded/wasted except for blocks produced in the longest-chain. Has weak economic security incentives. Weak to 51% attacks.

"Crypto fees will continue to get more expensive? Since every full node must store every transaction and use electricity, this makes the transaction cost proportional to the number of nodes. This really can add up.

Assuming a bitcoin transaction takes 250 bytes of data and there are 20,000 full nodes. Each transaction takes up 5MB total. That‚Äôs a lot for one transaction! 5MB on AWS S3 costs 1/100 of a cent (USD) per month. Assuming bitcoin remains for 100 years, the transaction cost could be as high as $0.12. This is ignoring the fact that the number of nodes could grow and that there are other costs as well (eg electricity). All blockchains that attempt to have full nodes (eg ethereum cardano) have this problem.

To be fair, all nodes in a server farm could all share one record of the blockchain so it‚Äôs hard to say how many copies of the blockchain there truly are.

"The Rise of Modular Blockchain - Why you should care It might come as a surprise for some of you but, IMO, a paradigm shift is underway, and its name is modularity. The days of a monolithic blockchain design might be counted.

**What are Modular and Monolithic Blockchains?**

In a *Monolithic* blockchain, all tasks are carried out on a single layer or a cluster of closely interconnected chains that operate on the same layer. Nodes in a monolithic chain are responsible for executing consensus, ensuring data availability and validating transactions. As a result, these nodes simultaneously serve all four core blockchain functions. This makes it harder or impossible to scale without sacrificing Security or Decentralization.

**Examples:** Solana, Bitcoin, Cardano, BSC, etc.

On the opposite end, we have *Modular*. Modularity simply means that the blockchain design revolves around the division of the system into distinct layers, each specializing in crucial functions. This means that the tasks are divided and are able to scale independently. "

"Zero-Knowledge Proofs Explained Hey everyone, I hope you will find this helpful. Please chime in to refine this. So, my project is using zero-knowledge proofs and I am finding out that people who are not familiar with the concept (and even those who think they are) are struggling to understand it. I came up with a story below to help non-technical and technical people understand how this would work on a blockchain.

So, here goes:

John has $1,000 and needs to send $100 to Bill. Nobody can know the amounts that are being sent or how much money John or Bill has. 

Let's break this down.

1. John owns $1,000.

Instead of waving cash around, he seals the money inside a thick, light-proof envelope. Before he seals it, he presses a special wax stamp that embeds a cryptographic code tied to ""$1,000 + some random noise."" That stamp is tamper-evident: anyone can scan it later and be certain nothing inside has been swapped, yet the scan reveals zero about the real amount.

The stamp fixes the value without exposing it.

"Implementing NFTs to Decentralize Music Royalties: A Case Study on Polygon Network Blockchain technology has opened up new possibilities in the music industry, particularly in decentralizing ownership and the distribution of royalties. Traditionally, music royalties have been concentrated in the hands of major investors and industry gatekeepers, leaving little room for independent participation.

A recently developed model utilizes NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) on the Polygon network to represent fractional ownership of a song‚Äôs royalty rights. Each NFT grants its holder a proportional share of the royalties generated by the song. This is enabled through smart contracts that automate revenue distribution transparently and efficiently.

This approach brings forward several technical insights worth discussing:

* **Scalability via Polygon:** The Polygon network was chosen for its low fees and fast transaction throughput, which are crucial for managing the microtransactions that come with music royalties.

"Building A Token With Community Managed Inflationary / Deflationary Mechanisms Let me begin by saying if this post is deemed inappropriate it was not my intention to violate the rules, and although the discussed topic is inflation, it is about building mechanisms into a token, not about markets. Additionally, I am not citing the name of my project, or trying to promote it in any way, just looking for advice from fellow developers.



That said, a little context. The distributed capability of blockchain tech is what originally drew me to the crypto space 10 or so years ago. I have always loved the concept of essentially using greed as a key motivator to create a secure and trustless asset. I find it inspiring, as fundamentally, no ecosystem can exist free of avarice, and historically, the accumulation of malefactors is what inevitably degrades the integrity of the system. Although far from perfect, the opportunities created by this technology seems to offer the closest function for turning the greed of potential bad actors into a positive force, by rewarding merit"

"Bitcoin's security budget has declined 40% over the past 4 years - Fixing Bitcoin's long-term security problem ####**The elephant in the room: Bitcoin's declining security budget**

Like all Proof of Work (PoW) networks, Bitcoin is mostly secure from 51% attack (majority attacks) as long as its security budget remains high relative to the total value protected. There have been plenty of PoW blockchains with smaller security budgets that have been ruined by 51% attacks, which led to large reorgs or double-spends. Historically, Bitcoin's security budget has increased between each cycle, but this increase has been decreasing from the start, and has now reached an inflection point. Transaction fees on average still only cover 1% of the block reward and are completely insufficient to cover for Bitcoin's security.

As of March 2025, Bitcoin security budget, when CPI-adjusted, has **declined over 45%** in real value compared to 4 years ago (sources: ""Miners Revenue"" from Blockchain.com, CPI data from St. Louis FRED).

"Blockchains algorithm full privacy  Hello Reddit!

I'm excited to share with you all an innovative approach to blockchain security and privacy that I‚Äôve been working on. The core idea of this algorithm is to enhance both transaction confidentiality and user anonymity without compromising the integrity of the blockchain itself. This is achieved primarily through the use of pseudonyms for each transaction, and I'd love to explain how it works!

Key Features:

1. Pseudonyms for Sender and Receiver:
Every transaction on the blockchain involves a pseudo-generated public address for both the sender and the receiver. These pseudonyms are essentially temporary identities tied to a private key that can only be used for that specific transaction. By doing so, the blockchain ensures that there is no direct link between the user‚Äôs real-world identity and their on-chain activities, enhancing privacy.

2. Transaction Fragmentation:
Transactions are fragmented into smaller parts that are independently validated, meaning that even if pa"

"[Thoughts on my idea]: Using blockchain to create ""proof of impact"" for charity donations
 I'm aiming to solve a problem within philanthropy of mismanagement of resources/lack of transparency when using funds that are donated.

I'm brainstorming an idea which would be a platform where charities would have to issue some sort of NFT to each donor, which would allow donors to see direct proof of how their donations made an impact.

For example, if someone donated $10 for 10 trees to an organization that plants trees, the charity would issue 10 unique NFT's (via smart contract) to prove that these trees have actually been planted (via geotag for the exact coordinates, a photo or something else- not important in this example). This would serve as a ""proof of impact"" and would provide transparency in how funds are managed and donations used.

So if there is a fork there is also the eventuality of double spending I guess(?) let's suppose that there are two ecommerce (A and B) accepting bitcoin and they are connected to the btc network, the ecommerce A gets the X version of the fork and ecommerce B gets the Y version of the fork, so I can spend the same coin on both ecommerce because they have different versions of the blockchain right?

DISCUSSION  I have been digging a lot the resent years, and now after reading the book Read Write Own (2024) by Chris Dixon it stands really clear to be that the most essential contribution blockchain technology potentially is providing is applications, networks and building blocks that dont need to rely on inherent trust from a third party. This is because their legitimacy can be Proven as a feature of blockchain. The protocol and how it operates is opensource and transparent. 

With a foundation like that, one can build great thing.  

  
Q1: What do you think is the main contribution of crypto and blockchain technology? 

Q2: And what do you think of this foundation is terms of further building, does it make a difference from how things are done today? "
"Layerswap V8 - first permissionless atomic bridging protocol # The Problem with Existing Bridging Protocols

1. **Delegated Security:**¬†All existing bridging protocols avoid addressing security directly, instead delegating it to third parties like Oracles or so called DVNs. This delegation introduces complexity and potential security risks, relying on external entities rather than solving and ensuring security inside the protocol.
2. **Permissioned Network Integration:**¬†None of these protocols provide a permissionless approach to network integration. As a network developer, you have to convince these bridge protocols and their operators to support your network, which can be costly and time-consuming. This permissioned system hinders the seamless expansion and integration of new blockchain networks.

# Our Solution: PreHTLCs

At Layerswap, we aimed to address both of these issues by developing an improved version of HTLCs (Hashed Time Lock Contracts) used in Atomic Swaps, called¬†**PreHTLCs**. This innovation provides:

"Breaking Down HTLCs - Hashed Time-Lock Contracts  In the realm of decentralized finance and blockchain technology, maintaining transaction security and ensuring trustlessness is of utmost importance. Off-chain asset transfers need to be safeguarded against theft or fraud, which introduces challenges such as payment routing risks and potential node failures during HTLCs (Hashed Time-Locked Contracts) in transit.

HTLCs offer a robust solution to these issues. These contracts allow for conditional payments based on the revelation of a specific secret, or more technically, the preimage of a hash. The HTLC mechanism comprises two crucial elements: the hashlock and the timelock. The hashlock is satisfied when the correct preimage is provided, enabling the transfer of funds to the recipient, or alternatively, the timelock ensures that the sender's funds are refunded if the transaction fails within the specified timeframe.

HTLCs are vital for ensuring that transactions are either completed successfully or funds are returned to the sender. T"
"Decentralized Technologies: Reimagining Business Structures In 2021, I discovered the revolutionary potential of blockchain technology. Captivated by its promise to drastically alter our digital lives, I was particularly moved by its ethos of individual empowerment, which I believe is necessary for a more prosperous society.

One underexplored yet promising facet of blockchain is its potential to transform corporate structures. This could fundamentally change how we operate, allowing individuals to participate more fully in decision-making and resource allocation. However, current solutions (DAOs) have been disappointing. To address this, I aim to explore how decentralized technologies can help us build more effective and efficient alternatives to our current organizational structures.

2. Can I find out the rough size of all transactions done on the platform?

3. Can I find out if they use a third party payment processing provider or transfer funds directly?

"Great technology, Polkadot has, I am told, but no focus on the end user. Are there any similar technology being used by other chains that has a better user adoption plan? I like very much the concept of modular architecture through its Relay Chain and parachains (L2s). 

Just a little more information:

The Relay Chain (their layer zero) provides the base for network security and consensus, while parachains are individual blockchains that plug into it, allowing for specialization. 

Interoperability in Polkadot is achieved as parachains can communicate directly and share data or assets, using the Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP) protocol. 

This architecture allows for seamless interaction among different chains within the Polkadot network.

The reasoning for my question is that it seems to me that on the Polkadot subreddit most of the posts is about people complaining that the chain was made for developers. IKR, this is a tech sub here. "

What's stopping a bad actor from making a fake chain that is longer than the real one? Surely there's no way to validate it, as there is no ""proof of stake"" in the actual block.

I thought that maybe the last block's hash could be used as a seed for a weighted random selection of the next validator. That way the next validator can be predicted. And each block could be signed by it's validator to proove that it is genuine. But a list of current staking nodes would be needed to select a validator, which is constantly changing. That would mean that there would be no way of verifying that a validator of a block was selected fairly. Am I missing something?"

"Why Stablecoins Depeg # Introduction 

If you've been in or around crypto long enough you will have at least once heard the term ""stablecoin"".

These are tokens whose price is meant to mimic some other asset such as a real world currency or asset.

But you will often find that these assets have ""depegs"", which is a situation where they are no longer at the same price as their target asset.

# Background

primarily all major stablecoins hitherto use a system of collateralization and redemption.

This differs slightly between stablecoins but the overarching theme is that any unit of the stablecoin can be redeemed for a collateralized asset such as Ether, the stable can also be borrowed/issued in exchange for Ether.

What this equates to in practice is that the stablecoin tokens themselves are just as speculative as any other crypto asset, their price can rise and dip.

When people buy; the price goes up, when people sell; the price goes down, a sufficiently large stabelcoin will not show huge price changes fr"
"CEX vs DEX Is the term CEX kind of a misnomer in the crypto space? I know that exchanges like Coinbase/CDC centralise wallet management, KYC (for regulation) and provide features akin to traditional trading apps such as order limits etc. 

CEXs maintain an order book and matches orders as well, however, when it comes to actual trade execution of the asset, everything still executes on the underlying chain right? 

They provide liquidity through their own accounts or LPs, but there is no exchange that can suspend trading on any asset, unlike a traditional exchange (NYSE etc.) that can pull almost all liquidity on an asset with suspensions (or even the whole exchange).

If Coinbase stopped all trading today, I could still trade the same assets (coins) on another exchange (both CEX and DEX), whereas if NYSE suspends trading on a stock, there is no other (easy) way I can trade that stock, even if I use another broker etc. I could go OTC but that's still subject to the exchange's approvals.

"If crypto is decentralized, how can a network be updated? Hey people!

I've had this question for a while, there are probably some wrong assumptions here so please bare with me, and correct me if I'm wrong.

So my underatanding is this: The idea of crypto is to exist on a blockchain, which is maintained by a network of computers. Each computer provides its individual confirmation for a given transaction, and so as more computing power in the network, the more unrealistic it is for an individual to manipulate transactions on the ledger, as it would require this individual (or group) to have more than 50% of the network's computing power. 

Which means this is a form of a decentralized machine which no one has control over, by design. 

In that case, how come many (already online) cryptos networks are in active development? How come this decentralized beast can just be modified and updated?

And if the team behind a certain crypto can just release updates to it, doesn't that imply that they could also shut it off?"

So we set out and ended up building a full stack system called Patchwork which goes from base contracts through protocol and development tools. Will link at bottom for those interested. The workflow is that a developer, perhaps familiar with ORMs and conventional app data modeling, models up their data with JSON and then runs it through a tool that produces contracts that efficiently pack the data and support the relationships between the models.

"Filecoin vs Sia vs Storj economic values for node runners and the longevity of the network From what I've read so far, it seems Filecoin is the cheapest out of the three ([\~$0.194667/TB/mo](https://file.app/)), compared to Sia ([\~$2.50/TB/mo](https://siascan.com/)) and Storj ([$4/TB/mo](https://www.storj.io/pricing)). If we look at the storage cost alone, this is a no-brainer for *the users* (assuming they're equally easy to use for now). However, for **node runners** who lend their data storage, why should they run their Filecoin nodes at all? Would it be *a lot* better (\~20x more incentive) to run Storj nodes?

"What are the technologies involved and that you are targeting?

None were listed so I'll assume Etherum and MetaMask;

Deploy your smart contract on Goerli (make note of the ABI and address). Then in your frontend app use Ethers.js to connect to metamask via ethers.providers  and you will be able to get the signer when users connect their wallet and you can have it perform actions like registering or logging events.  Make sure in testing you get a Goerli faucet for free testnet ETH.

Once you have them connected to your app you can call contract methods like registerStakeholder(""Distributor"") or logEvent(""Arrived at warehouse""). These are signed by MetaMask and broadcast to the blockchain. You can show a simple form for each action and use await tx.wait() to confirm it's mined. To display live updates, listen for events like StakeholderRegistered or EventLogged using Ethers.js‚Äôs event API.

"I spent the last 4 years in web3 and have decided to leave it - can relate to everything you said.
I think the answer has multiple facets based on my experience 
1. Web3 founders typically belong to one of 3 personas - Idealogues ( believe so much in the original ethos of web3 that they don‚Äôt care about users needs as much), hackers (really smart talent - great at bootstrapping a DApp but don‚Äôt have the patience and skill to tide through difficult times to build long lasting companies - these folks move onto another product) and grifters (it is what it is).  None of the 3 personas actually lead towards building generational companies 

2. Unfortunately the Token is the product. This has meant all the effort is around making the token work - fix it to a narrative, marketing is around token and not the product and so on. Very few people actually talk about the product and for this I blame the VCs. Token economics gives the quick liquidity unlike traditional equity ownership to VCs so the"

"I‚Äôve had the same frustrations seeing incredible Web3 concepts fall flat because the community sticks to Web2 behavior. But there are exceptions, Galaxis is one that really stood out to me recently. They're actually launching a real space mission in June, 100g of Hungarian plant seeds will go into polar orbit to test how space affects plant growth. It‚Äôs the first of several missions going all the way to Mars by 2032."
[removed]
"It‚Äôs a community first, a technology second. The blockchain and cryptography tech is already popular but it‚Äôs not meant for mainstream news. Not all tech is meant to have mass adoption.

I started reading the room last year when I saw some leaders in the community move to another project every 6 months. Hard to believe what they preach now lol.

I only follow projects focused on healthcare or have survived a few years in the industry."
"Most Dapps and other web3-based apps are not user-friendly; they make it in a way that you won't feel encouraged to use them. Most devs are all about the money, and that's it. IMO, to get a good dapp that can be an everyday use case, it needs to be on a blockchain that is extremely fast and charges less than 1 cent in fees; only MOVE offers that RN. If dApps are cheap to use like Web2-based apps, then everyone will start adopting them gradually."
"I totally agree! It‚Äôs frustrating when Web3 projects don‚Äôt gain the traction they deserve. If the community isn‚Äôt actively using these tools, it‚Äôs hard to see them succeed. The gap between Web3‚Äôs potential and its current reality is definitely something worth discussing."
"I feel that web3 is the least impacted by AI at present. Because those centralized organizations of web1 and web2 tend to use AI to save manpower, but web3 does not care about the waste of manpower but cares more about equality and freedom of manpower. For example, tiktok of web2 will definitely use AI to review videos, so that they can hire fewer people, but there is no such thing as review in the web3 field. You can post whatever you want on bluesky."
"No, because web3 is still in the initial phase, and the risk and complexity is too high for it to easily replace it's developers. 

Although the job number is already low, but those who have it wouldn't face that trouble."
"Galaxis are making space research participatory. NFTs for seed launches, real time mission data on-chain, super under the radar."
"AI‚Äôs automating the boring stuff in Web3 (smart contracts, testing), but devs still need to design systems, fix AI‚Äôs mistakes, and build new stuff AI can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs not replacing jobs‚Äîjust changing them. Learn both AI and blockchain, stay adaptable, and you‚Äôll be fine."

Thank you everyone for your input. That‚Äôs really helpful!
"I think it's more those who realized that they are at the mercy of the US if they are using US software or products. I think the concern is very muted in American companies just because the risk isn't there. Most of the companies I've worked for were American and super heavy into .NET so highly dependent on Microsoft and I don't think Microsoft being an American company was ever something that came up as a risk to us.

I will say, that I am wary of anything written or developed primarily by the Chinese unless it's known to be a safe product (e.g. Vue.js)  but I will look to see if its open source and written in a way that non-chinese speakers are reviewing the code.

I think there is a market though for open source + decentralization as a way to reduce the risk of other countries meddling with trade, but a corporation or government entity has no good way forward to pick the proper software or standards until the governments give better guidance.  For now, you'll see people switch to op"
Yes. You can also build an e-commerce platform using Web3 to allow US users to buy heroin. Are you asking if it would be legal to evade taxes?
"Blockchain can't solve the problem where a shipment is worth more than $800 but no one is paying the tariff, eventually the process leads to it being sold at auction. So you can get a shipment to the US port without paying tariff but unless someone pays the tariff when picking it up it cannot be technically imported"
"The Web3 setup does sound feasible. Dev product companies can definitely help build decentralized e-commerce platforms where everything from listing to payment is handled on-chain. Using wallets, automated workflows, and smart contracts to enable trustless transactions makes sense on the tech side.

But I‚Äôm not too sure about the part on avoiding tariffs. Even if enforcement is tough, once a physical item goes through customs, it still gets checked. Sending it by postal parcel doesn‚Äôt automatically mean it skips taxes, especially if there‚Äôs a pattern or high volume.

If it‚Äôs a digital good, then maybe. But for physical stuff, I don‚Äôt really see how blockchain changes the customs process. Curious to hear what others think ‚Äî maybe there‚Äôs a workaround I haven‚Äôt thought of?"
"The only way you can avoid the customs process on the shipment is by lying on the declaration, but that is _fraud_ and even if you got away with a network of _gifts_ if someone loses something along the way, then the couriers have responsibility to cover items worth _zero_ so any bad actor along the way will basically have your operation incur in losses."

"Health records are private, blockchains are public - that already suggests a true blockchain is not the best fit. K-anonymity could be used to help a public blockchain and private blockchain line up, but again you are taking something designed to be decentralized so it must benefit, not hinder from this property.  This is a big idea that I don't foresee an independent developer's code being pitched to major health organizations, instead I think the health industry is already working on a blockchain solution"
"Isn‚Äôt the back-and-forth and delays a feature of insured healthcare, and not a bug? Helps insurance deny claims because of incorrectly filed paperwork, time limits, etc"
This is not a web3 problem
"That‚Äôs true, but the primary concern here is privacy, as u/paroxsitic  pointed out below. I beleive in it I‚Äôve even invested in a startup offering integration solutions for these sectors, yet adoption has been slow."
"mainnet is not viable for micropayments, fees are prohibitive.

solana hits all your needs: ultra-low fees, fast, widely used by NFT/mini-app/bot creators. tools like Backpack, Phantom, and Solana Pay make it user-friendly.

base has great EVM support and is becoming the home of meme culture so if you want to attract a coinbase-savvy, twitter-fueled crowd, this might work well too.

arbitrum and optimism are solid with mature infra, strong liquidity and negligible gas fees, but their onboarding friction, serious builder vibes make them less suited for culturally aligned, fun, meme-worthy projects."
"I‚Äôm a huge Hedera fan. If you launch on HashPack, I‚Äôm gonna check it out."

Base and flow both have lower fees than the options you've listed. I would look into them.
"There is a huge market for that. but unfortunately, the idea itself is broken asf.

The main problem is that when you come to the point where you need to make a decision, it becomes clear enough that AI can be an assistant only but can't validate the idea, unfortunately

You can use it as your reviewer, but we don't need a platform for that

So, to summarize, a lot have tried, and I know 1 case that can be close to succeeding, but through 1y+ of dev and more needed"
"not sure [https://www.ufandao.com](https://www.ufandao.com)  
but still not that much have been spotted, time to build, there is a real request 

but still the question of addition-value from such platform? everyone knows what YC can do to founder"
Ideas are a dime or dozen. A team that can execute is much harder to find. AI won‚Äôt help with that.
"Judging from the goal description, this platform does not need to be decentralized, so what is the purpose of decentralizing this platform?"
"From my personal view, I would visit it everyday if I can contribute and get something from it. And the main utility for me is to have something - other communities don't have. 

Not just posting news that everyone have seen, memes that are boring and stuff. But have a real utility (no signals)

Research your TA and make something they like and something that others struggle with  
Clear and simple to me"
"I think the answer is in your question: Web3 is hypefinancialized. If we could prove more use cases outside of finances and hone in on marketing them, the trust would build back.

I am currently trying to pivot as a graphic designer towards product design, and I want to design products in the Web3 space. The technology Web3 offers - even aside from blockchain - has enormous potential."
"Honestly, what would keep me checking in every day isn't just promises of moonshots or endless hype threads (though, let's be real, a little sprinkle of hopium never hurts!). It's when a community nails these things, do have a few points i love the most  
  
\- Real Transparency, Zero BS**,** nothing builds trust faster than a team that openly shares updates, admits mistakes, and doesn't hide behind vague promises. When devs and founders are upfront and straightforward, it‚Äôs seriously refreshing, keep an eye on everything going on in the space now  
  
**-** Consistent Value Drop, not airdrop or smth like that, but communities that regularly share insights, alpha leaks, educational deep-dives, or even just practical guides are gold. how was DAOs born? ha-ja  
  
\- Actual fun and real vibes, all understandable in here  
  
also really gud affect has solid governance, you gotta gran the community the power - like meaningful governance votes and decisions that shape the project - and you"
"Honestly, what would keep me coming back daily is if a community had consistent updates, cool interactions like AMAs, and some real rewards for participating, all while being super transparent and open about what's going on."
"My requirements are simple really, their utility is so useful I want to give them money to use it (rare) or its solves a problem I think needs solving and I can recommend it to people I see on perhaps a yearly basis, so if its solving supply chain issues with blockchain, I don't even care. My community is webdevs so I might be special in that I like dWeb advancements and can share them with colleagues but dislike memecoins and casinos and frankly I couldn't care less what their coin price is if its a true utility token meant only as a temporary exchange for services and not to HODL"
"Have a shared goal and vision. It is very important that those benefit the community members. 

I remember when I was part of an online forum a long time ago. It was about art and members would post their latest artwork, get it reviewed by other members. There were battles were 2 artists competed against each other and the community voted. The goal was to develop and nurture the culture of this artform. For individuals it was growth and improving their skills.
I was excited to see how other reacted to something I had put in hours of work and I was excited to see the growth of others."
"communities in web3 are incentive driven, to retain attention daily, you need to blend rewards with identity, status, and belonging."
"I would say there are a lot of projects with a focus on tokenized tickets, so their side solution is merch and more  
So, def check these first and after that you can validate the idea

Can share more if you'd like"
"Comes down to where you are distributing the merch. 

If you are traveling to Singapore for Token2049, you are better off producing the merch in Malaysia than locally where you live and having to haul it with you when you fly.

Where are you looking to hand out merch?"
This is a great idea! I think it would be perfect for NFTs or DePIN.
Web3 meet ups are in trend you surely have a market I am into printing if you need any support lmk.
A search for web3 merch shows up a few results. These dropshipping websites have very little profit margin if they want to compete and very much depends on momentum and the deals you can broker with brands and companies. If you have a budget to go to conventions and meetups and offering marketing opporunities then it could be worthwhile but if you plan to just throw up a website and hope to get sales organically or even with advertising you will find web3 is very niche and dropshipping is flooded market
"For sure, there‚Äôs a big opportunity for merch in Web3! Custom designs for events or projects with cool, comfy styles could fill a gap in the market, especially since it‚Äôs still so unorganized."
"The Web3 merch market is definitely promising and stable, especially since the space thrives on enthusiasm (at least in the early stages). And in terms of creativity, a successful merch producer needs to truly understand the project, actively participate in events, and translate the community‚Äôs vibe into high quality designs.

However, many merch creators are already offering these services, sometimes even for free, just to gain exposure or build relationships with projects. If you go to the conference (especially in Asia), the merch ideas, and businesses are already pretty much very competitive."
"Yes DIDs can be used. There are a few projects based around DIDs but the two biggest protocols for transferring social media users from platform is probably 

Bluesky's AT Protocol which uses DIDs and allows moving profiles and followers to other services that support AT. I mention them because they are likely the biggest and most funded development efforts towards decentralized social media and the ability to move profiles.

Mastodon's ActivityPub, which doesn't use DIDs and isn't so much meant as a protocol for data transfer as much as it is a platform to create an ecosystem. The main difference is there are many established websites using this paradigm already, where as bluesky is a bit newer"
"This is a good idea, but unfortunately it is not very practical. It requires users to voluntarily upload their social relationships on a decentralized platform before they can be applied to other platforms. If only you upload your social relationships, and your followers and fans do not upload them, there is no way to migrate your social relationships."

"For MiCA - you need to have some capital + you need to have a specifically structured whitepaper

Also, some countries got delays for the MiCA implementation, so if you are focused on some single-country - Spain can be the case"
"in the US If you plan to push or have people think the token is an investment, you need to register it as a security with the SEC (MiFID II in EU).  If it is a true cryptocurrency/utility token then there should be no presale, no ICO, and you should have clear language that the token is a utility a better chance of avoiding securities classification.

If you plan to serve EU customers then you may need to comply with MiCA. I am not well versed on the specific beyond what I am saying, but it does seem like having a token isn't the proper global payment play anymore if business itself has to comply to every country's unique regulation, in the past it was on the customer to ensure things were reported right but it seems EU registers token creation regulation and not just taxation and reporting.

Unless you have a really good reason to launch your own token, you are better off using a pre-existing one. Accepting payments in crypto wont be hindered as much, as BitPay and all the big players"
"might shake some things actually  
smth like EU ripple effect  
If the team or service providers working on token issue have any ties to Europe, MiCA's forcing them to pause, rethink, or fully pivot their strategies, that's why you're hearing ""can't issue tokens now, sorry.', even if they are in US, they're basically trying not to get wrecked by new compliance rules, not keep waiting"
"USDC is likely to see increased adoption in the future. However, USDT is currently more suitable for global use."
"one major issue is seamless UX and abstraction, users shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about whether they‚Äôre on Ethereum, an L2, or a rollup. rn, interacting with these layers still requires technical knowledge, wallets, and gas fees, which create friction.

interoperability is another challenge, blockchains and scaling solutions don‚Äôt communicate well with each other, and current bridging solutions are slow, expensive, and vulnerable to hacks. then decentralization versus performance is another tradeoff.

and the biggest gap? consumer products. right now, most blockchain applications cater to traders, developers, or crypto-native users.

but its not all gloomy, we are progressing, just not in obvious ways. the hype cycle distracts, but beneath it, real innovation is also happening, scalability, abstraction, and better UX are evolving. it‚Äôs just a matter of time before Web3 stops feeling like ""Web3"" and just becomes part of the internet.

#"
"A lot of Web3 projects are backed by VC money, so they‚Äôre all about quick profits instead of actually building something long-term. Meme coins and hype tokens print cash fast, while the real use cases like decentralized identity, supply chain tracking, and self-sovereign data need actual commitment.  
  
Also Web 3 is just too complicated for common folks"
"Tbh, adoption for some great projects is here, at least for some specific needs - but you need to have a general shift worldwide from fast dopamine and casino-style engagement to really bring the utility aspect back to the market (I really hope that era we have now will eventually come to an end)  
  
Same as you, I wonder why do we have so many speculation-only projects, but would say that once you are deep into everything we have on the market - solutions are obvious and extremely useful. While for others it may be hard to understand how to buy a token on any DEX

So, my take here, is that you can just do what you love, while others will slowly come and use the stuff you have built. But once we have the mania for money, people who are doing ordinary businesses start selling pickaxes to people, who don't know what is the real utility for gold - same risk, same problems  
  
Wait once the builders have everything they need to build something decent and there are a lot of great products"
"Masses have an unbelievable ability to turn any great idea into a pile of shit. 

Take social networks for example. The initial idea was knowledge sharing and connection. The result is misinformation, propaganda, manipulation, anxiety and stress. 

The same happened to ""web3"". The only part that will possibly survive is the DeFi side of things. The rest is going to end up as a niche as masses are to stupid to get it and too spoiled by having everything (seemingly) free in web2. 

AI is taking over the hype wave from crypto and the money follows. Web3 is going to be its own microcosm with some fans and users but it is not likely to be mass adopted."
"It's going to take decades even after all of the infra, and inter operability issues have been resolved. Web3 got the stink of crime on it. And unless and until all of the foundational issues are resolved there is no way that legitimate utilization of Web3 will happen.

Remember humans are loss averse mob thinkers. And there's too many hedgerows in people's way to use it. The platforms and users don't align yet, And they won't for a little bit more. Parabolic adoption isn't real when it comes into contact with irrational human economics."
"I think the biggest problem is that the security issues that web3 solves are not the focus of most ordinary people. For the elite who pay attention to this, web3 is indeed revolutionary for them, but their number is too small, so it seems that the world has not changed. Therefore, the next key should be what other problems web3 can solve besides security issues. We need to find answers to people's questions, rather than forcing people to ask questions with answers."
"The space has been swamped by speculative money and it's blinding most people.

And many joined the industry without having any proper idea of what Web3 means beyond a few surface statements.

We need to get more people exposed to the ideas and vision of Web3.

I am a little confused about the ""instead of solely relying on voting"" part.

Such as what missions will there be? how much token does a person earn for doing what for which missions?   The only way I see this being done would be through proposal and voting within the DAO.  

Is your idea that the more skin you have in the mission (e.g. more participation tokens) then the more decision making you can do within the DAO or sub-DAO?   Trying to understand the full intent of this idea an"
"Join a few DAOs to get a feel for community engagement and how in practice most DAOs struggle with that part and end up with few people truly being engaged. I see daos that work being those who see themselves as communities and use a DAO wrapper to handle some form of governance or incentive for participation. I.e. if the mission and purpose then design the incentives through a DAO. Most successful DAOs start as ‚ÄúEventually a DAO‚Äù, because it‚Äôs always easier to make a good soup if there is a base prepared by a good chef to which all participants can add their ingredients. Starting from an empty pot where anyone can throw ingredients, no matter how tasty individually, makes a mess."

"I come from the LAMP days and have grown to appreciate PHP since PHP5. I can confirm PHP can be used for web3 but the majority of APIs will consider PHP as lower support  - but most of them still support PHP.

If PHP is the language you are most familiar with, do not be shyed away, you just must understand what disadvantages you are up against. The main one being a PHP project may get abandoned, as is the case with the most popular eth php code web3.php. So just make sure you know the php code you end up using will be well supported with security updates.  Just having the code work isn't good enough with web3, you need to make sure all dependencies are maintained in order to thwart security issues"

Like Laravel itself, anything can be done in PHP but the only reason to do it in PHP is if that is a non-negotiable constraint.

If the only reason is because you are way more familiar with PHP than Javascript, my suggestions is to bite the bullet and build it in Javascript and let AI help you with the correct syntax. It's never been easier to switch languages and you will grow tremendously as a developer."

"Decentralizing compute is difficult because in order to trust the result from one computer, typically you have to do the same calculations multiple times just to ensure the node did the calculation correctly.

Let's say you have a consensus of 5, that is, given random nodes you want at least 5 strangers to agree on a result.  This means all computation has to go through 5x more compute than a centralized and trusted setup. That is 5x the cost. 

There are two ways this can work;


A) start trusting nodes more the more they do useful work

B) if the calculations are complex but verification of the answer is simple



A is dangerous and best case you still have 2x compute because never should it trust a node blindly.


B is where innovation can happen. Most AI training and inference computations are difficult to verify without essentially redoing the calculation. The primary challenges are:

Decentralizing AI is tricky, but not impossible. Open-source models (like Mistral and LLaMA) are a good start, but the real challenge is infrastructure‚Äîtraining and running AI at scale requires insane amounts of compute power. This is where decentralized compute networks (like Akash, Bittensor, or Gensyn) could help, distributing AI workloads across a network instead of relying on centralized data centers.

If you get $300 in crypto as income (for services/products) and then by the time you exchange you get $350, it would be marked as $300 business income and $50 capital gain. Certain CEX may initially report you got a $350 capital gain and would need to be documented"

"Instead of remembering a long seed phrase, you just log in the way you normally do to other websites. When you log in, Web3Auth creates a special key for your wallet, but it splits this key into two pieces, one from your social login and one stays on web3auth

It's like having a safe that needs two keys to open - even if someone hacks your Google account or Web3Auth, they still can't access your wallet because they only have half the key.

While it's more secure than centralized exchanges and great for onboarding new users, it does require trusting Web3Auth's infrastructure and social login providers. For maximum security, hardware wallets remain the safer option."

Web3 indeed has a lot of untapped potential, and since it's relatively new, it can be challenging to grasp at first.

"This is such a promising direction! Designing an AI agent that automates tasks within decentralized systems while balancing trustless on-chain interactions and off-chain logic is a real frontier challenge. One approach I‚Äôve seen gaining traction is combining local LLMs with modular SDKs.   
  
This allows for better scalability, lower latency, and tighter control over governance decisions without exceeding gas limits or triggering flags.

It‚Äôs interesting you mention Base and Solana - I‚Äôve been exploring how privacy-focused designs can complement performance on those chains. There's a growing push for modular frameworks that handle these issues holistically. For example, I came across a hackathon recently focusing on privacy-first SDKs and interoperability-seems like a great space for ideas like this to evolve, especially with a $40K prize pool encouraging innovation."
"You can consider tech that uses reverse gas models which is more in line with web2. If a user posts a message, you then pay for the space and compute it uses to consume and host that message.  The Internet computer is more in line with that type of billing where you pay for space and compute as the dapp owner but the end user it's seamless.

On the IC 10,000,000  messages (1kb each) cost $0.05/mo (10mb). You also have a small cost for compute and having the canister running. This is probably a better approach if your focus is a dapp"
"In a nutshell, yes. The user will have to pay every time the write operation occurs on a blockchain, there is no way around that.

Thats why you should never use ethereum mainnet for write heavy dapp, you can use one of the many Layer2 solutions (Base, Optimism, Arbitrum etc) where transaction fees are cheap."
"Yes, you understood it correctly.

What do you mean by ""there is no such apps""?

Web3 is not a replacement for web2. In some (many) cases, to use a Blockchain is not necessary.

"Yes you‚Äôre right, but In Web2, every API call costs money too, but it‚Äôs really cheap. While you could run your own blockchain on an EC2 instance, it wouldn‚Äôt be more efficient than using MongoDB.
As technologists, we should choose the right tool for the right use case. Web3 and blockchain are tools designed for decentralization."
"I am having a similar strat issue with my project. Eventually I want to create an L2 using a rollup, than deploy a token contract and add account abstraction and a paymaster where the token is used to pay for transactions and just see how much I can get transaction cost down when bundling optimistically or not. An enterprise piece will fund and subsidize eventual further transactions, with further rewards on the consumer side, which then opens the door to eventual consumer transactions toward RWAs.
Please refute this strategy in this thread, if any.

Otherwise, if anyone reading this has the technical chops to execute this, and would like to join my project, please PM with your LI profile."

"To the part of paying everything where transaction are involved (writing inputs) i would like to give some insights regarding web2 and web3.
Yes it is free to Interact with any app and no. For instance Google is free but they use your data (which are priced) in exchange for the services they provide. For  app you pay a subscription or One time fees (almost extinct). At the end of the day, writing something on a Server has a cost event If it is Hidden because using internet requires energy consumption. If you are Not the One paying for it is the Real argument. For instance, using credit card to pay (financial system) is free for the user (Not talking about credits interests but transactions) but the merchants pay fees. So as a user we consider it normal that we pay and get Our purchase without paying fees .
